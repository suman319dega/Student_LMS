# 🎓 Student LMS (Python + Excel)

A lightweight and beginner-friendly **console-based Learning Management System (LMS)** built in Python.  
This project allows users to manage students, courses, enrollments, and marks — all stored in an Excel file using **pandas** and **openpyxl**.

This LMS is **NOT web-based**, making it very simple to understand, extend, and learn from.
