# Student_LMS
A lightweight and beginner-friendly console-based Learning Management System (LMS) built in Python. This project allows users to manage students, courses, enrollments, and marks — all stored in an Excel file using pandas and openpyxl.  This LMS is NOT web-based, making it easy to understand, extend, and learn from.
